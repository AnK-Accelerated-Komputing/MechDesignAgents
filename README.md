# MechDesignAgents File Summary

| File Name                     | Likely Purpose                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `__init__.py`                  | Initializes the `mechdesignagents` Python package by importing all necessary components from agent and design files.                             |
| `agents.py`                    | Defines multiple agents for user interaction. EachEach agent has specific configurations and roles in the chat system.|
| • Designer Agent | A user proxy that interacts with humans to gather design requirements.|
| • Retrieve User Proxy Agent | An agent that assists in retrieving content relevant to design problems.  | 
| • CadQuery Code Writer | Generates Python code to create CAD models using CadQuery. |
| • Code Reviewer | Reviews the generated code for adherence to specified formats and guidelines.  |  
| `designer_cadcoder.py`         | Simple implementation where the designer agent initiates a chat with the CadQuery code writer based on a design problem input by the user. |
| `designers_no_rag.py`          | Implements a group chat system without RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), where all agents can interact to resolve a design problem collaboratively.     |
| `designers_rag.py`             | Similar to designers_no_rag.py, but integrates a retrieval component, allowing the CadQuery code writer to retrieve relevant content before generating code.      |
| `mechagents_old_streamlit.py` | This appears to be a user interface built using Streamlit, allowing users to select models and input API keys for interaction with the agents. It initializes the agents and manages user input. |




## FAQ

#### How to check the install packages? 
``` bash 
pip list
```

#### How to verify the installion? 

```bash
pip show <package_name>
```

#### If error occur during Installation? 
Make sure your pip and setuptools are up to date by executing command: :
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

```

####  Dependency conflict between the installed version of package? 

##### Example Error: : installing collected packages: numpy
ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed. This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts.
nlopt 2.8.0 requires numpy<3,>=2, but you have numpy 1.26.4 which is incompatible.

Solution: Uninstall and reinstall with compatible versions. For example:
To installs a specific version of the package (e.g., numpy==1.24.0).

```bash
pip uninstall -y numpy && pip install numpy==1.24.0
```


Replace <conflict_package_name> with the actual package name and <replace_your_required_version> with the version that matches the requirements of other packages in your project.

```bash
pip uninstall -y <conflict_package_name> && pip install <conflict_package_name>==<replace_your_required_version>
```
